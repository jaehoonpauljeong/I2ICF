--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

o Main Presentation Summaries

Jiwon Suh:
- Presented on the I2INF Hackathon project.
- Highlighted the implementation of intent translators for JSON-to-YAML conversion.
- Emphasized its use in edge cloud and SDV environments with 5G networks.

Yoseop Ahn:
- Presented the I2INF Problem Statement.
- Focused on the need for a standardized framework and interfaces for In-Network Functions (INFs) in NFV, SDN, and AI-driven systems.

Mose Gu:
- Outlined the I2INF Framework, including modular components (e.g., cloud controllers and edge analyzers) and key interfaces.
- Highlighted the integration of programmable network devices (PNDs) and intent-based management.

Kehan Yao and Jaehoon (Paul) Jeong:
- Discussed a use case for I2INF in Data Center Networking.
- Introduced interfaces bridging compute and network domains for AI-driven workflows.
- Addressed the role of GPU parameter aggregation and its acceleration through programmable network devices.

o Discussion & Q&A
Marco Liebsch:
- Requested clarification on distinguishing I2INF from traditional network functions.

Hyunsik Yang:
- Asked if the project included SDV use cases and requested references for the interface or not.
- Emphasized that compute domain interfaces differentiate I2INF from I2NSF.

Kehan Yao:
- Emphasized the need for compute domain interfaces for AI applications like GPU aggregation.
- Highlighted the importance of collaboration with operators and vendors.
- Raised concerns about overlaps with the CATS WG and the need for clear scoping.
- Identified challenges in balancing compute vs. network domain configurations.

Hyunjeong Lee:
- Noted potential overlap with NMRG and emphasized the need for clear delineation between working groups and research groups.

Ed Austin:
- Suggested integrating automated monitoring into intents for adaptive configurations.

o Action Items
- Enhance Resources: Share reference materials addressing interface-related concerns raised during the discussion.
- Clarify Differentiation: Conduct discussions to clearly differentiate I2INF from CATS WG while aligning with COIN goals.
- Draft Guidelines for Intent Translation: Develop guidelines with a focus on edge cloud use cases and SDV relevance.
- Mailing List Setup: Establish mailing list: i2icf@ietf.org
- Community Collaboration: Engage with telecom operators and vendors to gather input and encourage adoption.
- Draft Consolidation: Merge problem statement, use cases, and framework drafts into a cohesive document.

o Closing Remarks
- The Chair thanked participants for their active engagement and highlighted the next steps, including preparations for the I2INF BoF at IETF 122 in Bangkok.
- Participants were invited to join the mailing list and review meeting materials for ongoing collaboration.
