o Charter
- The I2ICF group tries to standardize a framework and its interfaces to configure, monitor, and manage In-Network Computing Functions (ICF) in Computing in the Network (COIN) and comes up with a framework to manage such ICFs in an autonomous way. An ICF is a Programmable Network Device (PND) in an In-Network Computing (INC)  environment that can have multiple kinds of capabilities to provision a user's service, consisting of Network Functions (NFs) and Application Functions (AFs).

- The I2ICF aims at a standard framework and interfaces for provisioning ICFs for the requested services in an Edge or Cloud. It can collaborate with CATS WG for computing-aware traffic steering at edge and cloud computing systems.

- The I2ICF group tries to specify a problem statement for the Interface to In-Network Computing Functions (I2ICF) for user services both on the network-level and application-level. In-Network Computing Functions (ICF) include Network Functions (NFs) that are defined in the context of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). ICF also includes Application Functions (AFs) for the sake of Internet-of-Things (IoT) Devices, Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Intent-Based Networking (IBN) can also be used to compose user services and consist of a combination of ICFs in a target network. This group investigates the need for a standard framework with the interfaces for ICFs, in terms of applications with the need to run Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the network and interoperability among multi-vendor ICFs. The I2ICF group aims at specifying a problem statement, use cases, and a framework with common interfaces for the management of ICFs. This group also aims at standardizing an I2ICF framework and the YANG data models for the capabilities of ICFs and the I2ICF interfaces. An intent or a policy for the ICFs can be constructed by an XML file based on those YANG data models. The delivery of such an intent or a policy can be performed by either NETCONF or RESTCONF.
