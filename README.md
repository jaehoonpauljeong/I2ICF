o Goal of In-Network Functions (I2INF)
- I2INF identifies the gaps for In-Network Functions (INF) in Computing in the Network
  (COIN) and comes up with a framework to manage such INFs in an autonomous way.
  An INF is a Programmable Network Device (PND) in an In-Network Computing (INC)
  environment that can have multiple kinds of capabilities to provision a user's service,
  consisting of Network Functions (NFs) and Application Functions (AFs).
- The I2INF group aims at specifying a problem statement and a framework with
  common interfaces for the management of INFs for a user's services.
- This group aims at standardizing an I2INF framework and the YANG data models for
   the capabilities of INFs and the I2INF interfaces. An intent or a policy for the INFs can
   be constructed by an XML file based on those YANG data models. The delivery of
   such an intent or a policy can be performed by either NETCONF or RESTCONF.
- This group will specify the following items:
(1) Interface to In-Network Functions (I2INF): Problem Statement,
(2) A Framework for Interface to In-Network Functions (I2INF), and
(3) YANG Data Models for the I2INF Capability and Interfaces.
