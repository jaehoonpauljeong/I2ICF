o Goal of In-Network Functions (I2INF)
- I2INF identifies the gaps for In-Network Functions (INF) in Computing in the Network
  (COIN) and comes up with a framework to manage such INFs in an autonomous way.
  An INF is a Programmable Network Device (PND) in an In-Network Computing (INC)
  environment that can have multiple kinds of capabilities to provision a user's service,
  consisting of Network Functions (NFs) and Application Functions (AFs).
- This group tries to specify a problem statement for the Interface to In-Network
  Functions (I2INF) for user services both on the network-level and application-level.
  In-Network Functions (INF) include In-Network Computing Functions (INCF) which
  are defined in the context of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and
  Software-Defined Networking (SDN). INF also includes In-Network Application
  Functions (INAF) which appear in the context of Internet-of-Things (IoT) Devices,
  Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). 
  Intent-Based Networking (IBN) can be used to compose user services and consist
  of a combination of INFs in a target network. This group investigates the need for
  a standard framework with the interfaces for INFs, in terms of applications with the
  need to run Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the network and interoperability among
  multi-vendor INFs.
- The I2INF group aims at specifying a problem statement, use cases, and a framework with
  common interfaces for the management of INFs.
- This group aims at standardizing an I2INF framework and the YANG data models for
   the capabilities of INFs and the I2INF interfaces. An intent or a policy for the INFs can
   be constructed by an XML file based on those YANG data models. The delivery of
   such an intent or a policy can be performed by either NETCONF or RESTCONF.
- This group will specify the following items:
(1) Interface to In-Network Functions (I2INF): Problem Statement and Use Cases,
(2) A Framework for Interface to In-Network Functions (I2INF), and
(3) YANG Data Models for the I2INF Capability and Interfaces.
