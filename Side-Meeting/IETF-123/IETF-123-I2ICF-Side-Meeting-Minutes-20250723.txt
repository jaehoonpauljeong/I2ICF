o Pedro:
1. Use cases must be reflected to the I2ICF hackathon project.
2. Network intent and control intent both are specified, but something that puts them together is missing.
3. Network intent is well-known. But vehicular intent is not clear, so it should besomething specific in vehicular networks and use cases.

o Chris: 
1. A domain-specific language (DSL) should be prepared to model data.

o IKE: 
1. Regarding the number of uses cases, solutions need to be focused on one specific aspect. 
2. Different components in the I2ICF framework have to play together.
3. Specify what an in-network computing function is. 
The name of in-network computing function is not clear. So the definition of in-network computing function should be clarified.
